# demo_selenium_js

### Use WebdriverJS (npm selenium-webdriver) to make a simple demo for automating web pages testing.

#### Design

 - use POM for web page mapping;
 
 - assert with Chai;
 
 - the webdrivers are not included in the repository; you need to download it from to the project root;
 
 - you can find some browser drivers here:

    [Firefox47+](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/)
      
    [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_11_1.html)
